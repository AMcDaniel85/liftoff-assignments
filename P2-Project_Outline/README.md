### Overview
Are you tired of having the same things for dinner? Do you have an abundance of recipes and want to have them organized in one location? Well let me introduce you to Recipe-selector, a recipe storage app with a tool that can randomly select recipes for you! With this app you can take out the guess work and generate random recipes or build lists of randomly chosen recipes.
The app will also store recipes and combinations of recipes so you can revisit meal plans! It can also store frequent ingredients so you can build a pantry ahead of time. Said goodbye to piles of recipe cards and binders with the Recipe-selector!
